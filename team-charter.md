## Role Identification

Roles required within the team will be fulfilled by any capable team member as required, no team member has been explicitly given a role to fill. The exception is the scribe and host for regular meetings. For each meeting, the role of scribe and host will rotate from the previous meeting.

The responsibilities for each meeting are:

- Host – Creates the agenda for a given meeting and chairs the meeting to keep it on track.
- Scribe – Creates the minutes for a given meeting and shares minutes on the wiki.

## Ground Rules

### Assessment Ground Rules

During each team member meeting (not sponsor or oversight), the team will allocate the tasks, team member responsible, and the timeline for each assessment item. The expected level of quality of the task will be up to the standard to earn an HD.

### Meeting Ground Rules

It is expected that all team members will attend all scheduled meetings. The scheduled oversight meeting will start on Tuesday 14th March and will be repeated every fortnight.

Meetings between the team members will be scheduled [insert scheduled date time] and will be conducted over Discord whenever possible.

Meetings between the team members and the sponsors will be scheduled [insert date time] and will be conducted over [insert meeting platform].

The agenda for each meeting will be created by the team member who will be the host for that meeting. With the host responsibility rotating for each given meeting.

The minutes for each meeting will be created by the team member who will be the scribe for that meeting. With the scribe responsibility rotating for each given meeting.

The host and scribe for a given meeting cannot be the same team member.

### Team Attitude Ground Rules

Team members should always strive to hold a positive and supportive attitude towards their team, oversight supervisor, and sponsor. There should always be a willingness to help other team members or seek help when necessary.

### Acceptable Reason Ground Rules

If a team member cannot attend a meeting or meet a deadline, sufficient notice and acceptable reason is required in writing as soon as practicably possible. Examples of sufficient reasons are:

- Personal emergency.
- Technology issues.
- Known clash with work or school.

### Communication Ground Rules

Communication between team members will be conducted through the team’s private Discord server. This includes all text messaging and meetings. Communication between team members and the oversight supervisor will be conducted through email, with the team member communicating with the sponsor ensuring that all other team members are CC’d into the email. Communication between team members and the sponsor will be conducted through email, with the team member communicating with the sponsor ensuring that all other team members are CC’d into the email.

### Remediation Ground Rules

Team members must respect each other and differing opinions. Aggressive and disrespectful behaviour will earn the team member a strike against them. All correspondence between team members is required to be confidential unless agreed upon by all team members. 

If a team member becomes aware that they cannot complete a task assigned to them by the known deadline, they must notify the rest of the team within 5 hours of knowing this. If a team member has not communicated that they are unable to complete a task within 24 hours of its deadline, then it will be assumed they will complete the task on time.

### Decision Ground Rules

Each team decision needs to be agreed by all team members. If there is a disagreement and the team cannot reach a decision with 10 minutes, then the decision will be decided by a majority vote.

## Conflict Resolution

Any conflicts that arise between team members should attempt to resolve privately. However, if this cannot be resolved privately, they should seek the assistance of another team member to act as a mediator.

If work has been left uncompleted by the due date, other team members should look at the work down and help the assigned team member complete the task. If the work is still not completed after another 24 hours, a different team member who believes they can complete the task should take over responsibility.

Any team members that break the agreements as set out in this team charter will have a strike against them. First strike, a warning should be given to the team member as well as assistance provided to help prevent further strikes. Second strike, a final warning given to the team member as well as a plan to ensure another strike does not occur. Third strike, the team member is removed from the team.
